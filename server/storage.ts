Long-term Memory persists across sessions. It includes:

1. IS THIS A GOOD FIT FOR AI?
AI excels at: Pattern recognition, language understanding, prediction, personalization
AI struggles with: Precise calculations, guaranteed correctness, explaining its reasoning

2. WHAT'S THE COST OF BEING WRONG?
Low stakes: Recommendations, search, suggestions
High stakes: Medical diagnosis, financial decisions, legal advice
Rule: The higher the stakes, the more human oversight you need.

3. DO YOU HAVE THE DATA?
AI needs data to learn. If you're starting fresh, consider: Do you have enough examples? Is your data representative? How will you handle edge cases?`,

BUY (use APIs) when:

Set usage limits, cache responses, use cheaper models for simple tasks.

3. STREAM FOR UX
Long responses should stream token-by-token so users see progress.

4. LOG EVERYTHING
Store prompts, responses, and latency. You'll need this for debugging and improvement.

5. VALIDATE OUTPUTS
AI can return unexpected formats. Parse and validate before using.

COST OPTIMIZATION:
- GPT-4: ~$30/million tokens (powerful)
- GPT-3.5: ~$0.50/million tokens (fast, cheap)
- Use 3.5 for simple tasks, 4 for complex reasoning`,
